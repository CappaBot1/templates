# templates
A compilation of lots of templates for linux.

You will see a lot of `bunger` in these files because this is my chosen placeholder text. I use it for things like object or variable names so it is easy to understand the basic structure of different file types.

Feel free to contribute to this project if you somehow stuble upon this repository.
